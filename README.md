# vhdllib
My own VHDL components library.  Anything from a flip flop to a ROM.

## details
The library is divided in folders:
    * basic : elementary components such as AND, OR, etc
    * math : from half adders to ALUs
    * storage : from flip flops to register files
    * mem : RAM, ROM
    * fsm : a collection of various fsm and their various design techniques
