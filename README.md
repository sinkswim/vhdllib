# vhdllib
My own VHDL components library.  Anything from a flip flop to a ROM.

## details
The library is divided into folders:
* basic : elementary components such as AND, OR, etc
* math : from half adders to ALUs
* storage : flip flops, register files, etc.
* mem : RAM, ROM
* fsm : a collection of various fsm and their various design techniques
* control units: CUs for MIPS-like processors
